# MoviesIndustry_Correlation_EDA_RegressionModel
An end to end data analysis project on movies industry data, doing EDA, Correlation analysis, prediction using regression. 
The following tasks have been performed:

The data was imported and read doing an initial feature analysis.
The data was cleaned as required e.g. looking for null values, duplicate values, handling them, reduce redundancy in features etc.
EDA was performed on the data with the help of visualisation.
Correlation between the features was done and the important features on which the gross revenue of a movie is correlated was found out.
Finally we chose the highly correlated feature values and trained and machine learning model to predict the revenue of a film given all other features.

We used pandas,numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn libraries and packages in our project.
